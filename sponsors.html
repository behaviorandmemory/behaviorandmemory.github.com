			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>The Center of Cognition and Complex Systems of the Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC) is glad to host the symposium titled “Neural mechanisms of regulation of behavior and memory: recent advances and future perspectives” on July 5th and 6th, 2015.</p>
			<p>The area of cognitive science and neuroscience has shown an exponential growth in recent years. Scientific advances in the field of regulation of memory and behavior, including motivated behaviors and inflexible behavior such as habit learning, certainly have a great relevance for understanding psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, addiction and obesity.</p>
			<p>This symposium will bring together leading experts in the field of basic and clinical neuroscience and behavior, specifically in the fields of memory, stress, habit learning and addiction, in a program that will provide a broad scientific discussion about the future development of knowledge in these areas.</p>
			<p>The symposium will also host a Data Blitz session, where the attendees will be able to present their recent findings and receive feedback from the audience. This will allow further interaction between young and senior investigators. </p>
			<p>The main objective of this symposium is to discuss recent advances and future perspectives in the memory and behavior research field. Our goal is to allow a close interaction among students, postdocs and professors, providing a very good environment for the development of future collaboration projects between Brazilian and International scientists.</p>
